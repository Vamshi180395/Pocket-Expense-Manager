# Pocket-Expense-Manager
 Developed an android mobile application that keeps a record of all the expenses of an individual. An individual need to sign up and create his/her account to use the services of the application. Using his/her credentials a user can add/delete/edit and view all their expenses. Each expense may even be associated with an expense receipt. The app will also give an expense summary of every monthâ€™s expenses in the form of a pie chart.
